# MazeGame
A 2-player maze game designed for COP290


Be the first to overflow your progress bar, strategising your gameplay
with yulu-rides, pit-stops, recovery sessions and a lot of fun!

With a ticking clock, a strong opponent, vicious dogs,
angry bees and energy drain with movement
battle it out to emerge victorious

1) You lose the game if your energy reduces to zero
2) Money replenishes with time, use it at food joints for energy , or on a yulu for extra speed
3) Food at Hostel canteen costs lesser than the commercial joint :) Remember, though, only the night messes operate at night!
4) Dog bites are painful! A major hit on the energy, and a respawn after a 5 second recovery from the hospital.
5) Bee stings hurt less, a 5 second recovery period and a minor hit on the energy bar.
6) Yulu gets you fast, but drains wealth.  
7) Use the Zoom out command, for the bigger picture .
